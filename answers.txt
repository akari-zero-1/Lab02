1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
 
-->Yes, Java supports the creation of multiple constructors within the same class as long as they have different parameter lists. This capability, known as constructor overloading, allows you to define various ways to instantiate an object based on different input parameters.
